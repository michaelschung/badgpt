					<h2>Instructions</h2>
					Today, you will work on a practice problem that brings together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a page that displays movie posters.
					<p>
						<b>At the end of class, you must submit your code to the <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/" target="_blank">Gradescope</a> assignment titled "Review Problem."</b>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You do not necessarily have to finish this entire problem, but you should have plenty of time to make it at least through Part 3.</li>
						<li>Work together and help each other out as much as you want/need, <i>but each person must submit individually in the end.</i></li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2>Starting up</h2>
					<a href="../class-materials/review/res/4:12%20-%20review.zip">Download this starter code</a>, and unzip it inside your <span class="tt">Web-B1</span> folder. It contains the following items:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="tt">movies.html</span>, the main HTML file for today</li>
						<li><span class="tt">css/movies.css</span>, where you'll put your CSS code</li>
						<li><span class="tt">js/movies.js</span>, where you'll put your JavaScript code</li>
						<li><span class="tt">img</span>, a folder with 5 movie poster images</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2>Part 1</h2>
					<p>The goal of this section is to replicate the following page using HTML and CSS:</p>
					<img src="../class-materials/review/res/review-part1.png" width=600>
					<p>It doesn't matter if your sizing is slightly different, but make sure that the positioning is the same.</p>
					
					<h2>Part 2</h2>
					<p>The goal of this section is to add in some JavaScript code to replicate the following functionality:</p>
					<iframe width="600" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbAzs1iU6O4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p><i>Hint: here's how you make an array in JavaScript.</i></p>
					<div class="codebox">
						<br>
						<span class="tab"><span class="tt">var arr = ["hello", "there", "matey"];</span></span><br>
						<br>
					</div>
					
					<h2>Part 3</h2>
					<p>For this section, replace the "Movie Posters" header with the title of the movie currently being displayed, and make sure that it also changes when the button is clicked.</p>
					<iframe width="600" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67furUulyOs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					
					<h2>Part 4</h2>
					<p>Finally, add a second button next to the first one, and edit your code so that one moves forward in the progression, and the other moves backward.</p>
					<iframe width="600" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSiLzQDwrdE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>If you have time left over, feel free to fancy up your web page!</p>
					<p>Don't forget to submit your code to <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/" target="_blank">Gradescope</a> before the end of class.</p>
