					<h2>File Organization</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure to rename your assignment folder to use your name, instead of just <span class="tt">FirstnameLastname</span>.</li>
						<li>All images should be placed inside a sub-folder named <span class="tt">img</span></li>
						<li>All CSS files should be placed inside a sub-folder named <span class="tt">css</span></li>
						<li>All JavaScript files should be placed inside a sub-folder named <span class="tt">js</span></li>
						<li>If you wish to include any other resources, place those files in a sub-folder named <span class="tt">res</span></li>
						<ul style="margin-top: 0px"><li>This is short for "resources," and it's a common standard among programmers</li></ul>
					</ul>
					<h2>Example</h2>
					Here is an example of a well-organized file hierarchy, taken straight from Mr. Chung's HW1. If there were CSS or JavaScript files involved, those would be in their own folders.<br><br>
