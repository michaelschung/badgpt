# ShittyGPT

A silly little web app that lets you customize a chatbot to assume whatever personality you specify. Basically Character.AI but worse?

Built using Node, Express, and the OpenAI API.

Must input a valid OpenAI API key - if you're someone who knows me personally and wants to try it out, feel free to ask for mine.

## Running locally

```bash
node server.js
```

This will run the server on `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port is specified in `server.js`), serving `public/index.html` as the homepage.
