					<h2>Overview</h2>
					In this assignment, you will recreate a webpage consisting of HTML elements styled with CSS.
					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					To receive full credit on this assignment, you must create a webpage that displays the following:<br><br>
					<img src="img/hw2-example.png"><br><br>
					Notes on this image:
					<ul>
						<li>The red lines/numbers are NOT part of the webpage. They are just there for reference.</li>
						<li>As suggested by the labels, each box should be 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall.</li>
						<li>The text in each box should be in <span class="tt">monospace</span> font, and centered horizontally.</li>
						<li>The "odd" boxes should be <span class="tt">green</span> with <span class="tt">hotpink</span> text.</li>
						<li>The "even" boxes should be <span class="tt">yellow</span> with <span class="tt">blue</span> text. They should also be horizontally offset 100 pixels to the right.</li>
						<li>The final box is of type "even," except its text is in <span class="tt">fantasy</span> font, <span class="tt">grey</span> in color, and larger.</li>
						<li>The final box should also stick to the bottom-right corner of the screen, even if the window is resized.</li>
						<li>The space at the bottom of the window is not any particular height. If I shrink the browser window, then that space will shrink.</li>
						<li><i>You may notice that there seems to be a tiny bit of extra space on the upper and left sides of the window. This is an automatic 8 pixel margin given to the body of any webpage, and it will happen on its own. <b>You do not need to write code to make this space happen.</b></i></li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Code</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The document title (the one that shows up in the browser tab) should be <span class="tt">HW2: Lastname</span> (substitute your last name)</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Style</h4>
					Your code will also be graded on style, as usual. Refer to the <a href="../../../html/style-guidelines.html" target="_blank">Style Guidelines</a> for details.
					<h4>Organization</h4>
					Make sure that you organize your files according to the following specifications:
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure to rename your assignment folder to use your name, instead of just <span class="tt">FirstnameLastname</span>.</li>
						<li>All images should be placed inside a sub-folder named <span class="tt">img</span></li>
						<li>If you wish to include any other resources, place those files in a sub-folder named <span class="tt">res</span></li>
						<ul style="margin-top: 0px"><li>This is short for "resources," and it's a common standard among programmers</li></ul>
					</ul>
					
					<h2>Tips</h2>
					Here are some helpful pointers for this assignment:
					<ul>
						<li>If you don't remember how to do something, review your code from class or ask questions!</li>
					</ul>
