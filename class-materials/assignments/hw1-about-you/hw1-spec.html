					<h2>Overview</h2>
					In this assignment, you will create a pure HTML webpage with a short biography about yourself.
					<p><a href="hw1-example.html" target="_blank">Here is an example of a completed webpage</a>, made by Mr. Chung.</p>
					
					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					To receive full credit on this assignment, you must fulfill the following requirements (feel free to go above and beyond if you want!):
					<h4>Code</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>A title at the top of the page</li>
						<li>4 sections, each with 2 or more informative sentences about your life</li>
						<li>2 different types of header tags</li>
						<li>Thoughtful use of the &lt;p&gt; tag</li>
						<li>Thoughtful use of <b>bold</b> and <i>italicized</i> text</li>
						<li>3 images; make sure that no single image takes up an unreasonable amount of space</li>
						<li>1 list (ordered or unordered)</li>
						<li>2 hyperlinks</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Style</h4>
					Your code will also be graded on style, as usual. Refer to the <a href="../../../html/style-guidelines.html" target="_blank">Style Guidelines</a> for details.
					<h4>Organization</h4>
					Make sure that you organize your files according to the following specifications:
					<ul>
						<li>Your entire assignment should be in a folder titled <span class="tt">hw1-FirstnameLastname</span>, (with your name, obviously)</li>
						<li>All images should be placed inside a sub-folder named <span class="tt">img</span></li>
						<li>If you wish to include any other resources (see the hyperlink labeled "Michael's capstone project" in the example webpage), place those files in a sub-folder named <span class="tt">res</span></li>
						<ul style="margin-top: 0px"><li>This is short for "resources," and it's a common standard among programmers</li></ul>
					</ul>
					<h4>Thoughtfulness</h4>
					Another small part of your grade will come from the thoughtfulness of your writing. It doesn't have to be a masterpiece of literature, but it's pretty easy to tell if the whole thing was pulled together in 5 minutes right before class.
					
					<h2>Tips</h2>
					Here are some helpful pointers for this assignment:
					<ul>
						<li>500px is a good standard width for images</li>
						<li>If you don't remember how to do something, review your code from class or ask questions!</li>
					</ul>
