		<h1>The Many Adventures of Mr. Chung</h1>
		
		<h2>Childhood</h2>
		<img src="img/family.jpg" width=500>
		<p>Mr. Chung was born in <b>San Diego, CA</b>, the third of five children in his family. He wasn't known as "Mr. Chung" then, but rather by his first name, Michael.</p>

		<p>Michael spent most of childhood hanging out with his family, engaging in activities such as <b>lightsaber battles</b> and <b>road trips</b>.</p>
		
		<h2>High school</h2>
		<p>Michael attended <b><a href="https://mvhs.fuhsd.org/">Monta Vista High School</a></b> in Cupertino, CA. He didn't like it very much, but spent most of his time playing music anyway.</p>

		<p>Michael had been <b>playing the cello</b> since the age of 7, but really picked up in intensity in high school. He worked super hard, practicing 3 hours every day (5-6 during the summer!), and managed to pull in a few awards.</p>
		
		<h2>College</h2>
		<p>Michael went to <b>Stanford University</b>, where he studied Computer Science, with a concentration in Information Management &amp; Analytics.</p>
		<p>Initially, he had no idea what he wanted to major in, and it actually wasn't until sophomore year that he took his first college CS class. But he liked it so much that he just kept going, and eventually decided that he might as well make that his major.</p>

		<p><a href="other/cs224n-report.pdf">Michael's capstone project</a> involved creating a system that takes a text, and uses maching learning techniques to answer questions about the text. Pictured above is the poster used to present the project.</p>
		
		<h2>Jobs</h2>
		<p>Michael has worked a few different jobs throughout and after college. Here are a few of the job titles he has held:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cello teacher</li>
			<li>Teaching assistant</li>
			<li>Teaching intern</li>
			<li>Curriculum developer</li>
			<li>Fullstack programmer</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Loomis</h2>

		<p>In August 2018, Michael came to work at the <b><a href="https://www.loomischaffee.org/">Loomis Chaffee School</a></b> in Windsor, CT to teach computer science. This is when he became known as Mr. Chung.</p>
		<p>Mr. Chung has had a lovely time at Loomis thus far, and is thankful that his students are only <i>a little</i> crazy and <i>slightly</i> annoying. This is not to say that they don't drive him up the wall every day, but he enjoys them anyway. &#x1F609;</p>
